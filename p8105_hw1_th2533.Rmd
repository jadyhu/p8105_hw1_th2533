This is my solution to HW1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Problem 1
create a data frame with the specified elements

```{r}
prob1_df = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
    char_vec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
    factor_vec = factor(c("low","low","low","mod","mod","mod","mod","high","high","high"))
)

```

## Problem 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
```{r ex1 echo=false}



```
